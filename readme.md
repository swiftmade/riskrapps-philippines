### Background Photos / Custom Themes

You can create a theme and add a background photo for each project.
To do that, follow these steps:

1. Name your background photo in this format: *domain*.png
2. Place the background photo under these locations:
    * src/Assets
    * android/app/src/main/assets
3. Drag & drop the background photo inside the Xcode project.
4. Create a new entry inside src/Constants/Themes.js

That's all.
